## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning project focused on 3D brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans. The project aims to automate the segmentation process to assist medical professionals in diagnosing and treating brain disorders.

## Problem Statement
Brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is time-consuming and subjective when performed manually. Automated methods are needed to improve accuracy and efficiency in diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately segmenting brain tumor regions from 3D MRI scans. The model aims to achieve high segmentation accuracy, reducing the burden on medical professionals and improving patient outcomes.

## Process
1. **Data Gathering:** Collect 3D MRI scans and corresponding tumor segmentation masks from publicly available datasets or collaborate with healthcare institutions for data acquisition.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and augment 3D MRI scans to prepare them for model training. Perform intensity normalization and voxel resampling for consistency.
3. **Model Training:** Develop a 3D U-Net architecture using TensorFlow. Train the model on the preprocessed dataset, optimizing it to minimize a chosen loss function.
4. **Model Testing:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using a separate test dataset. Calculate quantitative metrics and conduct qualitative visual inspection for validation.
